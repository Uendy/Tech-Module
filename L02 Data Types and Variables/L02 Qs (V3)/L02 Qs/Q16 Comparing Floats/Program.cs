        // Instructions: Write a program that safely compares floating-point numbers (double) with precision eps = 0.000001. Note that we cannot directly compare two floating-point numbers a and b by a==b because of the nature of the floating-point arithmetic. Therefore, we assume two numbers are equal if they are more closely to each other than some fixed constant eps

        // Example: 
        // Number a      	Number b	        Equal (with precision eps=0.000001)         	                Explanation
        //  5.3                6.01                         False                                   The difference of 0.71 is too big (> eps)
