        // Instructions: Write a program, which reads a list of integers from the console and receives commands, which manipulate the list. Your program may receive the following commands: 
        //  •	Delete { element} – delete all elements in the array, which are equal to the given element
        //  •	Insert { element} { position} – insert element and the given position
        // You should stop the program when you receive the command Odd or Even.If you receive Odd  print all odd numbers in the array separated with single whitespace, otherwise print the even numbers.

        // Example: 
        //     Input                Output
        // 1 2 3 4 5 5 5 6           1 3
        //  Delete 5
        //  Insert 10 1
        //  Delete 5
        //  Odd
