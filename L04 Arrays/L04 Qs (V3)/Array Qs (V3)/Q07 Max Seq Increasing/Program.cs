        // Instructions: Write a program that finds the longest increasing subsequence in an array of integers. The longest increasing subsequence is a portion of the array (subsequence) that is strongly increasing and has the longest possible length. If several such subsequences exist, find the left most of them.
        // Example:
        //    Input          Output
        // 3 2 3 4 2 2 4    2 3 4
        // 4 5 1 2 3 4 5    1 2 3 4 5
        // 3 4 5 6          3 4 5 6
        // 0 1 1 2 2 3 3    0 1
